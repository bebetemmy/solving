        <h2>Input, Processing, and Output Exercise</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Task:</strong> Write a program that takes a user's name as input, processes it, and then
            displays a personalized greeting as output.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> If the user enters "John," the program should output "Hello, John! Welcome to
            the world of programming."
        </p>
        <p>
            This exercise will help you practice the fundamental concepts of input, processing, and output in
            programming.
